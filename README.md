Technologies Used: 
- NestJS for the backend
  - I have affinity to TypeScript backend technologies hence Nest. Besides, It's annotation-based syntax is quite similar to Spring Boot.
- Prisma for the ORM
  - My first-time using it. Heardsgreat things about it. Built-in entities and DTOs.   
- MySQL for the database
  - Classic choice, easy to setup 
- Angular for the frontend
  - My preferred frontend framework

Get started?

  I have containerised the whole app. So simply run `docker compose up --build`
